# Open LLMs for Sequential Recommendation: SBBD 2024 Experiments

## Overview
This repository contains the scripts and resources for the experiments presented in the paper "An Analysis of Open Large Language Models in Sequential Recommendation Tasks" at SBBD 2024. The study investigates the effectiveness of open large language models (LLMs) in predicting the next item in a sequence with and without fine-tuning.
